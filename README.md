# Parametric Hierarchical Matrix Approximations to Kernel Matrices
This repository contains Python code for computing parametric hiearchical matrix approximations to kernel matrices. It accompanies the paper


The results  in the [folder](https://github.com/awkhan3/ParametricHierarchicalMatrices/tree/master/Logs) were generated on a computer with an Intel Xenon w9-3575X processor and 258GB of RAM.

## Requirements
The Python code requires the following packages to generate the tables.
1. Numpy
2. Scipy
3. Numba
4. Teneva

## License

# Usage
To run all of the experiments:
1. clone directory,
1. delete the files in the Logs directory, and 
2. run the command "python3 run_test.py".
